"emma woodhouse , handsome , clever , and rich , with a comfortable home and happy disposition , seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence ; and had lived nearly twenty - one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her .": 48, "she was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate , indulgent father ; and had , in consequence of her sister ' s marriage , been mistress of his house from a very early period .": 49, "her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses ; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess , who had fallen little short of a mother in affection .": 50, "sixteen years had miss taylor been in mr . woodhouse ' s family , less as a governess than a friend , very fond of both daughters , but particularly of emma .": 51, "between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters .": 52, "even before miss taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess , the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint ; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away , they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached , and emma doing just what she liked ; highly esteeming miss taylor ' s judgment , but directed chiefly by her own .": 53, "the real evils , indeed , of emma ' s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way , and a disposition to think a little too well of herself ; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments .": 54, "the danger , however , was at present so unperceived , that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her .": 55, "sorrow came -- a gentle sorrow -- but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness .-- miss taylor married .": 56, "it was miss taylor ' s loss which first brought grief .": 57, "it was on the wedding - day of this beloved friend that emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance .": 58, "the wedding over , and the bride - people gone , her father and herself were left to dine together , with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening .": 59, "her father composed himself to sleep after dinner , as usual , and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost .": 60, "the event had every promise of happiness for her friend .": 61, "mr . weston was a man of unexceptionable character , easy fortune , suitable age , and pleasant manners ; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self - denying , generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match ; but it was a black morning ' s work for her .": 62, "the want of miss taylor would be felt every hour of every day .": 63, "she recalled her past kindness -- the kindness , the affection of sixteen years -- how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old -- how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health -- and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood .": 64, "a large debt of gratitude was owing here ; but the intercourse of the last seven years , the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed isabella ' s marriage , on their being left to each other , was yet a dearer , tenderer recollection .": 65, "she had been a friend and companion such as few possessed : intelligent , well - informed , useful , gentle , knowing all the ways of the family , interested in all its concerns , and peculiarly interested in herself , in every pleasure , every scheme of hers -- one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose , and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault .": 66, "how was she to bear the change ?-- it was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them ; but emma was aware that great must be the difference between a mrs . weston , only half a mile from them , and a miss taylor in the house ; and with all her advantages , natural and domestic , she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude .": 67, "she dearly loved her father , but he was no companion for her .": 68, "he could not meet her in conversation , rational or playful .": 69, "the evil of the actual disparity in their ages ( and mr . woodhouse had not married early ) was much increased by his constitution and habits ; for having been a valetudinarian all his life , without activity of mind or body , he was a much older man in ways than in years ; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper , his talents could not have recommended him at any time .": 70, "her sister , though comparatively but little removed by matrimony , being settled in london , only sixteen miles off , was much beyond her daily reach ; and many a long october and november evening must be struggled through at hartfield , before christmas brought the next visit from isabella and her husband , and their little children , to fill the house , and give her pleasant society again .": 71, "highbury , the large and populous village , almost amounting to a town , to which hartfield , in spite of its separate lawn , and shrubberies , and name , did really belong , afforded her no equals .": 72, "the woodhouses were first in consequence there .": 73, "all looked up to them .": 74, "she had many acquaintance in the place , for her father was universally civil , but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of miss taylor for even half a day .": 75, "it was a melancholy change ; and emma could not but sigh over it , and wish for impossible things , till her father awoke , and made it necessary to be cheerful .": 76, "his spirits required support .": 77, "he was a nervous man , easily depressed ; fond of every body that he was used to , and hating to part with them ; hating change of every kind .": 78, "matrimony , as the origin of change , was always disagreeable ; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter ' s marrying , nor could ever speak of her but with compassion , though it had been entirely a match of affection , when he was now obliged to part with miss taylor too ; and from his habits of gentle selfishness , and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself , he was very much disposed to think miss taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them , and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield .": 79, "emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could , to keep him from such thoughts ; but when tea came , it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner ,": 80, "\" poor miss taylor !-- i wish she were here again .": 81, "what a pity it is that mr . weston ever thought of her !\"": 82, "\" i cannot agree with you , papa ; you know i cannot .": 83, "mr . weston is such a good - humoured , pleasant , excellent man , that he thoroughly deserves a good wife ;-- and you would not have had miss taylor live with us for ever , and bear all my odd humours , when she might have a house of her own ?\"": 84, "\" a house of her own !-- but where is the advantage of a house of her own ?": 85, "this is three times as large .-- and you have never any odd humours , my dear .\"": 86, "\" how often we shall be going to see them , and they coming to see us !-- we shall be always meeting !": 87, "_we_ must begin ; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon .\"": 88, "\" my dear , how am i to get so far ?": 89, "randalls is such a distance .": 90, "i could not walk half so far .\"": 91, "\" no , papa , nobody thought of your walking .": 92, "we must go in the carriage , to be sure .\"": 93, "\" the carriage !": 94, "but james will not like to put the horses to for such a little way ;-- and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit ?\"": 95, "\" they are to be put into mr . weston ' s stable , papa .": 96, "you know we have settled all that already .": 97, "we talked it all over with mr . weston last night .": 98, "and as for james , you may be very sure he will always like going to randalls , because of his daughter ' s being housemaid there .": 99, "i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else .": 100, "that was your doing , papa .": 101, "you got hannah that good place .": 102, "nobody thought of hannah till you mentioned her -- james is so obliged to you !\"": 103, "\" i am very glad i did think of her .": 104, "it was very lucky , for i would not have had poor james think himself slighted upon any account ; and i am sure she will make a very good servant : she is a civil , pretty - spoken girl ; i have a great opinion of her .": 105, "whenever i see her , she always curtseys and asks me how i do , in a very pretty manner ; and when you have had her here to do needlework , i observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it .": 106, "i am sure she will be an excellent servant ; and it will be a great comfort to poor miss taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see .": 107, "whenever james goes over to see his daughter , you know , she will be hearing of us .": 108, "he will be able to tell her how we all are .\"": 109, "emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas , and hoped , by the help of backgammon , to get her father tolerably through the evening , and be attacked by no regrets but her own .": 110, "the backgammon - table was placed ; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary .": 111, "mr . knightley , a sensible man about seven or eight - and - thirty , was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family , but particularly connected with it , as the elder brother of isabella ' s husband .": 112, "he lived about a mile from highbury , was a frequent visitor , and always welcome , and at this time more welcome than usual , as coming directly from their mutual connexions in london .": 113, "he had returned to a late dinner , after some days ' absence , and now walked up to hartfield to say that all were well in brunswick square .": 114, "it was a happy circumstance , and animated mr . woodhouse for some time .": 115, "mr . knightley had a cheerful manner , which always did him good ; and his many inquiries after \" poor isabella \" and her children were answered most satisfactorily .": 116, "when this was over , mr . woodhouse gratefully observed , \" it is very kind of you , mr . knightley , to come out at this late hour to call upon us .": 117, "i am afraid you must have had a shocking walk .\"": 118, "\" not at all , sir .": 119, "it is a beautiful moonlight night ; and so mild that i must draw back from your great fire .\"": 120, "\" but you must have found it very damp and dirty .": 121, "i wish you may not catch cold .\"": 122, "\" dirty , sir !": 123, "look at my shoes .": 124, "not a speck on them .\"": 125, "\" well !": 126, "that is quite surprising , for we have had a vast deal of rain here .": 127, "it rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast .": 128, "i wanted them to put off the wedding .\"": 129, "\" by the bye -- i have not wished you joy .": 130, "being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling , i have been in no hurry with my congratulations ; but i hope it all went off tolerably well .": 131, "how did you all behave ?": 132, "who cried most ?\"": 133, "\" ah !": 134, "poor miss taylor !": 135, "' tis a sad business .\"": 136, "\" poor mr . and miss woodhouse , if you please ; but i cannot possibly say ` poor miss taylor .'": 137, "i have a great regard for you and emma ; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence !-- at any rate , it must be better to have only one to please than two .\"": 138, "\" especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful , troublesome creature !\"": 139, "said emma playfully .": 140, "\" that is what you have in your head , i know -- and what you would certainly say if my father were not by .\"": 141, "\" i believe it is very true , my dear , indeed ,\" said mr . woodhouse , with a sigh .": 142, "\" i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome .\"": 143, "\" my dearest papa !": 144, "you do not think i could mean _you_ , or suppose mr . knightley to mean _you_ .": 145, "what a horrible idea !": 146, "i meant only myself .": 147, "mr . knightley loves to find fault with me , you know -- in a joke -- it is all a joke .": 148, "we always say what we like to one another .\"": 149, "mr . knightley , in fact , was one of the few people who could see faults in emma woodhouse , and the only one who ever told her of them : and though this was not particularly agreeable to emma herself , she knew it would be so much less so to her father , that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body .": 150, "\" emma knows i never flatter her ,\" said mr . knightley , \" but i meant no reflection on any body .": 151, "miss taylor has been used to have two persons to please ; she will now have but one .": 152, "the chances are that she must be a gainer .\"": 153, "\" well ,\" said emma , willing to let it pass --\" you want to hear about the wedding ; and i shall be happy to tell you , for we all behaved charmingly .": 154, "every body was punctual , every body in their best looks : not a tear , and hardly a long face to be seen .": 155, "oh no ; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart , and were sure of meeting every day .\"": 156, "\" dear emma bears every thing so well ,\" said her father .": 157, "\" but , mr . knightley , she is really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor , and i am sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for .\"": 158, "emma turned away her head , divided between tears and smiles .": 159, "\" it is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion ,\" said mr . knightley .": 160, "\" we should not like her so well as we do , sir , if we could suppose it ; but she knows how much the marriage is to miss taylor ' s advantage ; she knows how very acceptable it must be , at miss taylor ' s time of life , to be settled in a home of her own , and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision , and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure .": 161, "every friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily married .\"": 162, "\" and you have forgotten one matter of joy to me ,\" said emma , \" and a very considerable one -- that i made the match myself .": 163, "i made the match , you know , four years ago ; and to have it take place , and be proved in the right , when so many people said mr . weston would never marry again , may comfort me for any thing .\"": 164, "mr . knightley shook his head at her .": 165, "her father fondly replied , \" ah !": 166, "my dear , i wish you would not make matches and foretell things , for whatever you say always comes to pass .": 167, "pray do not make any more matches .\"": 168, "\" i promise you to make none for myself , papa ; but i must , indeed , for other people .": 169, "it is the greatest amusement in the world !": 170, "and after such success , you know !-- every body said that mr . weston would never marry again .": 171, "oh dear , no !": 172, "mr . weston , who had been a widower so long , and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife , so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here , always acceptable wherever he went , always cheerful -- mr . weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it .": 173, "mr . weston certainly would never marry again .": 174, "some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed , and others of the son and the uncle not letting him .": 175, "all manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject , but i believed none of it .": 176, "\" ever since the day -- about four years ago -- that miss taylor and i met with him in broadway lane , when , because it began to drizzle , he darted away with so much gallantry , and borrowed two umbrellas for us from farmer mitchell ' s , i made up my mind on the subject .": 177, "i planned the match from that hour ; and when such success has blessed me in this instance , dear papa , you cannot think that i shall leave off match - making .\"": 178, "\" i do not understand what you mean by ` success ,'\" said mr . knightley .": 179, "\" success supposes endeavour .": 180, "your time has been properly and delicately spent , if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage .": 181, "a worthy employment for a young lady ' s mind !": 182, "but if , which i rather imagine , your making the match , as you call it , means only your planning it , your saying to yourself one idle day , ` i think it would be a very good thing for miss taylor if mr . weston were to marry her ,' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards , why do you talk of success ?": 183, "where is your merit ?": 184, "what are you proud of ?": 185, "you made a lucky guess ; and _that_ is all that can be said .\"": 186, "\" and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess ?-- i pity you .-- i thought you cleverer -- for , depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck .": 187, "there is always some talent in it .": 188, "and as to my poor word ` success ,' which you quarrel with , i do not know that i am so entirely without any claim to it .": 189, "you have drawn two pretty pictures ; but i think there may be a third -- a something between the do - nothing and the do - all .": 190, "if i had not promoted mr . weston ' s visits here , and given many little encouragements , and smoothed many little matters , it might not have come to any thing after all .": 191, "i think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that .\"": 192, "\" a straightforward , open - hearted man like weston , and a rational , unaffected woman like miss taylor , may be safely left to manage their own concerns .": 193, "you are more likely to have done harm to yourself , than good to them , by interference .\"": 194, "\" emma never thinks of herself , if she can do good to others ,\" rejoined mr . woodhouse , understanding but in part .": 195, "\" but , my dear , pray do not make any more matches ; they are silly things , and break up one ' s family circle grievously .\"": 196, "\" only one more , papa ; only for mr . elton .": 197, "poor mr . elton !": 198, "you like mr . elton , papa ,-- i must look about for a wife for him .": 199, "there is nobody in highbury who deserves him -- and he has been here a whole year , and has fitted up his house so comfortably , that it would be a shame to have him single any longer -- and i thought when he was joining their hands to - day , he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him !": 200, "i think very well of mr . elton , and this is the only way i have of doing him a service .\"": 201, "\" mr . elton is a very pretty young man , to be sure , and a very good young man , and i have a great regard for him .": 202, "but if you want to shew him any attention , my dear , ask him to come and dine with us some day .": 203, "that will be a much better thing .": 204, "i dare say mr . knightley will be so kind as to meet him .\"": 205, "\" with a great deal of pleasure , sir , at any time ,\" said mr . knightley , laughing , \" and i agree with you entirely , that it will be a much better thing .": 206, "invite him to dinner , emma , and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken , but leave him to chuse his own wife .": 207, "depend upon it , a man of six or seven - and - twenty can take care of himself .\"": 208, "chapter ii": 209, "mr . weston was a native of highbury , and born of a respectable family , which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property .": 210, "he had received a good education , but , on succeeding early in life to a small independence , had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged , and had satisfied an active , cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county , then embodied .": 211, "captain weston was a general favourite ; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to miss churchill , of a great yorkshire family , and miss churchill fell in love with him , nobody was surprized , except her brother and his wife , who had never seen him , and who were full of pride and importance , which the connexion would offend .": 212, "miss churchill , however , being of age , and with the full command of her fortune -- though her fortune bore no proportion to the family - estate -- was not to be dissuaded from the marriage , and it took place , to the infinite mortification of mr . and mrs . churchill , who threw her off with due decorum .": 213, "it was an unsuitable connexion , and did not produce much happiness .": 214, "mrs . weston ought to have found more in it , for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him ; but though she had one sort of spirit , she had not the best .": 215, "she had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother , but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother ' s unreasonable anger , nor from missing the luxuries of her former home .": 216, "they lived beyond their income , but still it was nothing in comparison of enscombe : she did not cease to love her husband , but she wanted at once to be the wife of captain weston , and miss churchill of enscombe .": 217, "captain weston , who had been considered , especially by the churchills , as making such an amazing match , was proved to have much the worst of the bargain ; for when his wife died , after a three years ' marriage , he was rather a poorer man than at first , and with a child to maintain .": 218, "from the expense of the child , however , he was soon relieved .": 219, "the boy had , with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother ' s , been the means of a sort of reconciliation ; and mr . and mrs . churchill , having no children of their own , nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for , offered to take the whole charge of the little frank soon after her decease .": 220, "some scruples and some reluctance the widower - father may be supposed to have felt ; but as they were overcome by other considerations , the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the churchills , and he had only his own comfort to seek , and his own situation to improve as he could .": 221, "a complete change of life became desirable .": 222, "he quitted the militia and engaged in trade , having brothers already established in a good way in london , which afforded him a favourable opening .": 223, "it was a concern which brought just employment enough .": 224, "he had still a small house in highbury , where most of his leisure days were spent ; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society , the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away .": 225, "he had , by that time , realised an easy competence -- enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining highbury , which he had always longed for -- enough to marry a woman as portionless even as miss taylor , and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition .": 226, "it was now some time since miss taylor had begun to influence his schemes ; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth , it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase randalls , and the sale of randalls was long looked forward to ; but he had gone steadily on , with these objects in view , till they were accomplished .": 227, "he had made his fortune , bought his house , and obtained his wife ; and was beginning a new period of existence , with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through .": 228, "he had never been an unhappy man ; his own temper had secured him from that , even in his first marriage ; but his second must shew him how delightful a well - judging and truly amiable woman could be , and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen , to excite gratitude than to feel it .": 229, "he had only himself to please in his choice : his fortune was his own ; for as to frank , it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle ' s heir , it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of churchill on coming of age .": 230, "it was most unlikely , therefore , that he should ever want his father ' s assistance .": 231, "his father had no apprehension of it .": 232, "the aunt was a capricious woman , and governed her husband entirely ; but it was not in mr . weston ' s nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear , and , as he believed , so deservedly dear .": 233, "he saw his son every year in london , and was proud of him ; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made highbury feel a sort of pride in him too .": 234, "he was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern .": 235, "mr . frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury , and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed , though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life .": 236, "his coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved .": 237, "now , upon his father ' s marriage , it was very generally proposed , as a most proper attention , that the visit should take place .": 238, "there was not a dissentient voice on the subject , either when mrs . perry drank tea with mrs . and miss bates , or when mrs . and miss bates returned the visit .": 239, "now was the time for mr . frank churchill to come among them ; and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion .": 240, "for a few days , every morning visit in highbury included some mention of the handsome letter mrs . weston had received .": 241, "\" i suppose you have heard of the handsome letter mr . frank churchill has written to mrs . weston ?": 242, "i understand it was a very handsome letter , indeed .": 243, "mr . woodhouse told me of it .": 244, "mr . woodhouse saw the letter , and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life .\"": 245, "it was , indeed , a highly prized letter .": 246, "mrs . weston had , of course , formed a very favourable idea of the young man ; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense , and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured .": 247, "she felt herself a most fortunate woman ; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought , where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled , and who could ill bear to part with her .": 248, "she knew that at times she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of emma ' s losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour ' s ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but dear emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations .": 249, "and then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of randalls from hartfield , so convenient for even solitary female walking , and in mr . weston ' s disposition and circumstances , which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together .": 250, "her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to mrs . weston , and of moments only of regret ; and her satisfaction -- her more than satisfaction -- her cheerful enjoyment , was so just and so apparent , that emma , well as she knew her father , was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity ` poor miss taylor ,' when they left her at randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort , or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own .": 251, "but never did she go without mr . woodhouse ' s giving a gentle sigh , and saying , \" ah , poor miss taylor !": 252, "she would be very glad to stay .\"": 253, "there was no recovering miss taylor -- nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her ; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to mr . woodhouse .": 254, "the compliments of his neighbours were over ; he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event ; and the wedding - cake , which had been a great distress to him , was all eat up .": 255, "his own stomach could bear nothing rich , and he could never believe other people to be different from himself .": 256, "what was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body ; and he had , therefore , earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding - cake at all , and when that proved vain , as earnestly tried to prevent any body ' s eating it .": 257, "he had been at the pains of consulting mr . perry , the apothecary , on the subject .": 258, "mr . perry was an intelligent , gentlemanlike man , whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of mr . woodhouse ' s life ; and upon being applied to , he could not but acknowledge ( though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination ) that wedding - cake might certainly disagree with many -- perhaps with most people , unless taken moderately .": 259, "with such an opinion , in confirmation of his own , mr . woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair ; but still the cake was eaten ; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone .": 260, "there was a strange rumour in highbury of all the little perrys being seen with a slice of mrs . weston ' s wedding - cake in their hands : but mr . woodhouse would never believe it .": 261, "chapter iii": 262, "mr . woodhouse was fond of society in his own way .": 263, "he liked very much to have his friends come and see him ; and from various united causes , from his long residence at hartfield , and his good nature , from his fortune , his house , and his daughter , he could command the visits of his own little circle , in a great measure , as he liked .": 264, "he had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle ; his horror of late hours , and large dinner - parties , made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms .": 265, "fortunately for him , highbury , including randalls in the same parish , and donwell abbey in the parish adjoining , the seat of mr . knightley , comprehended many such .": 266, "not unfrequently , through emma ' s persuasion , he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him : but evening parties were what he preferred ; and , unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company , there was scarcely an evening in the week in which emma could not make up a card - table for him .": 267, "real , long - standing regard brought the westons and mr . knightley ; and by mr . elton , a young man living alone without liking it , the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of mr . woodhouse ' s drawing - room , and the smiles of his lovely daughter , was in no danger of being thrown away .": 268, "after these came a second set ; among the most come - at - able of whom were mrs . and miss bates , and mrs . goddard , three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from hartfield , and who were fetched and carried home so often , that mr . woodhouse thought it no hardship for either james or the horses .": 269, "had it taken place only once a year , it would have been a grievance .": 270, "mrs . bates , the widow of a former vicar of highbury , was a very old lady , almost past every thing but tea and quadrille .": 271, "she lived with her single daughter in a very small way , and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady , under such untoward circumstances , can excite .": 272, "her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young , handsome , rich , nor married .": 273, "miss bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour ; and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself , or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect .": 274, "she had never boasted either beauty or cleverness .": 275, "her youth had passed without distinction , and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother , and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible .": 276, "and yet she was a happy woman , and a woman whom no one named without good - will .": 277, "it was her own universal good - will and contented temper which worked such wonders .": 278, "she loved every body , was interested in every body ' s happiness , quicksighted to every body ' s merits ; thought herself a most fortunate creature , and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother , and so many good neighbours and friends , and a home that wanted for nothing .": 279, "the simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature , her contented and grateful spirit , were a recommendation to every body , and a mine of felicity to herself .": 280, "she was a great talker upon little matters , which exactly suited mr . woodhouse , full of trivial communications and harmless gossip .": 281, "mrs . goddard was the mistress of a school -- not of a seminary , or an establishment , or any thing which professed , in long sentences of refined nonsense , to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality , upon new principles and new systems -- and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity -- but a real , honest , old - fashioned boarding - school , where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price , and where girls might be sent to be out of the way , and scramble themselves into a little education , without any danger of coming back prodigies .": 282, "mrs . goddard ' s school was in high repute -- and very deservedly ; for highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot : she had an ample house and garden , gave the children plenty of wholesome food , let them run about a great deal in the summer , and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands .": 283, "it was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church .": 284, "she was a plain , motherly kind of woman , who had worked hard in her youth , and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea - visit ; and having formerly owed much to mr . woodhouse ' s kindness , felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour , hung round with fancy - work , whenever she could , and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside .": 285, "these were the ladies whom emma found herself very frequently able to collect ; and happy was she , for her father ' s sake , in the power ; though , as far as she was herself concerned , it was no remedy for the absence of mrs . weston .": 286, "she was delighted to see her father look comfortable , and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well ; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated .": 287, "as she sat one morning , looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day , a note was brought from mrs . goddard , requesting , in most respectful terms , to be allowed to bring miss smith with her ; a most welcome request : for miss smith was a girl of seventeen , whom emma knew very well by sight , and had long felt an interest in , on account of her beauty .": 288, "a very gracious invitation was returned , and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion .": 289, "harriet smith was the natural daughter of somebody .": 290, "somebody had placed her , several years back , at mrs . goddard ' s school , and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour - boarder .": 291, "this was all that was generally known of her history .": 292, "she had no visible friends but what had been acquired at highbury , and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her .": 293, "she was a very pretty girl , and her beauty happened to be of a sort which emma particularly admired .": 294, "she was short , plump , and fair , with a fine bloom , blue eyes , light hair , regular features , and a look of great sweetness , and , before the end of the evening , emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person , and quite determined to continue the acquaintance .": 295, "she was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in miss smith ' s conversation , but she found her altogether very engaging -- not inconveniently shy , not unwilling to talk -- and yet so far from pushing , shewing so proper and becoming a deference , seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to hartfield , and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to , that she must have good sense , and deserve encouragement .": 296, "encouragement should be given .": 297, "those soft blue eyes , and all those natural graces , should not be wasted on the inferior society of highbury and its connexions .": 298, "the acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her .": 299, "the friends from whom she had just parted , though very good sort of people , must be doing her harm .": 300, "they were a family of the name of martin , whom emma well knew by character , as renting a large farm of mr . knightley , and residing in the parish of donwell -- very creditably , she believed -- she knew mr . knightley thought highly of them -- but they must be coarse and unpolished , and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect .": 301, "_she_ would notice her ; she would improve her ; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance , and introduce her into good society ; she would form her opinions and her manners .": 302, "it would be an interesting , and certainly a very kind undertaking ; highly becoming her own situation in life , her leisure , and powers .": 303, "she was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes , in talking and listening , and forming all these schemes in the in - betweens , that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate ; and the supper - table , which always closed such parties , and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time , was all set out and ready , and moved forwards to the fire , before she was aware .": 304, "with an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively , with the real good - will of a mind delighted with its own ideas , did she then do all the honours of the meal , and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters , with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests .": 305, "upon such occasions poor mr . woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare .": 306, "he loved to have the cloth laid , because it had been the fashion of his youth , but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it ; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing , his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat .": 307, "such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could , with thorough self - approbation , recommend ; though he might constrain himself , while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things , to say :": 308, "\" mrs . bates , let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs .": 309, "an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome .": 310, "serle understands boiling an egg better than any body .": 311, "i would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else ; but you need not be afraid , they are very small , you see -- one of our small eggs will not hurt you .": 312, "miss bates , let emma help you to a _little_ bit of tart -- a _very_ little bit .": 313, "ours are all apple - tarts .": 314, "you need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here .": 315, "i do not advise the custard .": 316, "mrs . goddard , what say you to _half_ a glass of wine ?": 317, "a _small_ half - glass , put into a tumbler of water ?": 318, "i do not think it could disagree with you .\"": 319, "emma allowed her father to talk -- but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style , and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy .": 320, "the happiness of miss smith was quite equal to her intentions .": 321, "miss woodhouse was so great a personage in highbury , that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure ; but the humble , grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings , delighted with the affability with which miss woodhouse had treated her all the evening , and actually shaken hands with her at last !": 322, "chapter iv": 323, "harriet smith ' s intimacy at hartfield was soon a settled thing .": 324, "quick and decided in her ways , emma lost no time in inviting , encouraging , and telling her to come very often ; and as their acquaintance increased , so did their satisfaction in each other .": 325, "as a walking companion , emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her .": 326, "in that respect mrs . weston ' s loss had been important .": 327, "her father never went beyond the shrubbery , where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk , or his short , as the year varied ; and since mrs . weston ' s marriage her exercise had been too much confined .": 328, "she had ventured once alone to randalls , but it was not pleasant ; and a harriet smith , therefore , one whom she could summon at any time to a walk , would be a valuable addition to her privileges .": 329, "but in every respect , as she saw more of her , she approved her , and was confirmed in all her kind designs .": 330, "harriet certainly was not clever , but she had a sweet , docile , grateful disposition , was totally free from conceit , and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to .": 331, "her early attachment to herself was very amiable ; and her inclination for good company , and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever , shewed that there was no want of taste , though strength of understanding must not be expected .": 332, "altogether she was quite convinced of harriet smith ' s being exactly the young friend she wanted -- exactly the something which her home required .": 333, "such a friend as mrs . weston was out of the question .": 334, "two such could never be granted .": 335, "two such she did not want .": 336, "it was quite a different sort of thing , a sentiment distinct and independent .": 337, "mrs . weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem .": 338, "harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful .": 339, "for mrs . weston there was nothing to be done ; for harriet every thing .": 340, "her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents , but harriet could not tell .": 341, "she was ready to tell every thing in her power , but on this subject questions were vain .": 342, "emma was obliged to fancy what she liked -- but she could never believe that in the same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth .": 343, "harriet had no penetration .": 344, "she had been satisfied to hear and believe just what mrs . goddard chose to tell her ; and looked no farther .": 345, "mrs . goddard , and the teachers , and the girls and the affairs of the school in general , formed naturally a great part of the conversation -- and but for her acquaintance with the martins of abbey - mill farm , it must have been the whole .": 346, "but the martins occupied her thoughts a good deal ; she had spent two very happy months with them , and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit , and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place .": 347, "emma encouraged her talkativeness -- amused by such a picture of another set of beings , and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of mrs . martin ' s having \" _two_ parlours , two very good parlours , indeed ; one of them quite as large as mrs . goddard ' s drawing - room ; and of her having an upper maid who had lived five - and - twenty years with her ; and of their having eight cows , two of them alderneys , and one a little welch cow , a very pretty little welch cow indeed ; and of mrs . martin ' s saying as she was so fond of it , it should be called _her_ cow ; and of their having a very handsome summer - house in their garden , where some day next year they were all to drink tea :-- a very handsome summer - house , large enough to hold a dozen people .\"": 348, "for some time she was amused , without thinking beyond the immediate cause ; but as she came to understand the family better , other feelings arose .": 349, "she had taken up a wrong idea , fancying it was a mother and daughter , a son and son ' s wife , who all lived together ; but when it appeared that the mr . martin , who bore a part in the narrative , and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good - nature in doing something or other , was a single man ; that there was no young mrs . martin , no wife in the case ; she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness , and that , if she were not taken care of , she might be required to sink herself forever .": 350, "with this inspiriting notion , her questions increased in number and meaning ; and she particularly led harriet to talk more of mr . martin , and there was evidently no dislike to it .": 351, "harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games ; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good - humoured and obliging .": 352, "he had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts , because she had said how fond she was of them , and in every thing else he was so very obliging .": 353, "he had his shepherd ' s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her .": 354, "she was very fond of singing .": 355, "he could sing a little himself .": 356, "she believed he was very clever , and understood every thing .": 357, "he had a very fine flock , and , while she was with them , he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country .": 358, "she believed every body spoke well of him .": 359, "his mother and sisters were very fond of him .": 360, "mrs . martin had told her one day ( and there was a blush as she said it ,) that it was impossible for any body to be a better son , and therefore she was sure , whenever he married , he would make a good husband .": 361, "not that she _wanted_ him to marry .": 362, "she was in no hurry at all .": 363, "\" well done , mrs .": 364, "martin !\"": 365, "thought emma .": 366, "\" you know what you are about .\"": 367, "\" and when she had come away , mrs . martin was so very kind as to send mrs . goddard a beautiful goose -- the finest goose mrs . goddard had ever seen .": 368, "mrs . goddard had dressed it on a sunday , and asked all the three teachers , miss nash , and miss prince , and miss richardson , to sup with her .\"": 369, "\" mr . martin , i suppose , is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business ?": 370, "he does not read ?\"": 371, "\" oh yes !-- that is , no -- i do not know -- but i believe he has read a good deal -- but not what you would think any thing of .": 372, "he reads the agricultural reports , and some other books that lay in one of the window seats -- but he reads all _them_ to himself .": 373, "but sometimes of an evening , before we went to cards , he would read something aloud out of the elegant extracts , very entertaining .": 374, "and i know he has read the vicar of wakefield .": 375, "he never read the romance of the forest , nor the children of the abbey .": 376, "he had never heard of such books before i mentioned them , but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can .\"": 377, "the next question was --": 378, "\" what sort of looking man is mr .": 379, "martin ?\"": 380, "not handsome -- not at all handsome .": 381, "i thought him very plain at first , but i do not think him so plain now .": 382, "one does not , you know , after a time .": 383, "but did you never see him ?": 384, "he is in highbury every now and then , and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to kingston .": 385, "he has passed you very often .\"": 386, "\" that may be , and i may have seen him fifty times , but without having any idea of his name .": 387, "a young farmer , whether on horseback or on foot , is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity .": 388, "the yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom i feel i can have nothing to do .": 389, "a degree or two lower , and a creditable appearance might interest me ; i might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other .": 390, "but a farmer can need none of my help , and is , therefore , in one sense , as much above my notice as in every other he is below it .\"": 391, "oh yes !": 392, "it is not likely you should ever have observed him ; but he knows you very well indeed -- i mean by sight .\"": 393, "\" i have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man .": 394, "i know , indeed , that he is so , and , as such , wish him well .": 395, "what do you imagine his age to be ?\"": 396, "\" he was four - and - twenty the 8th of last june , and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day ' s difference -- which is very odd .\"": 397, "\" only four - and - twenty .": 398, "that is too young to settle .": 399, "his mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry .": 400, "they seem very comfortable as they are , and if she were to take any pains to marry him , she would probably repent it .": 401, "six years hence , if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own , with a little money , it might be very desirable .\"": 402, "\" six years hence !": 403, "dear miss woodhouse , he would be thirty years old !\"": 404, "\" well , and that is as early as most men can afford to marry , who are not born to an independence .": 405, "mr . martin , i imagine , has his fortune entirely to make -- cannot be at all beforehand with the world .": 406, "whatever money he might come into when his father died , whatever his share of the family property , it is , i dare say , all afloat , all employed in his stock , and so forth ; and though , with diligence and good luck , he may be rich in time , it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet .\"": 407, "\" to be sure , so it is .": 408, "but they live very comfortably .": 409, "they have no indoors man , else they do not want for any thing ; and mrs . martin talks of taking a boy another year .\"": 410, "\" i wish you may not get into a scrape , harriet , whenever he does marry ;-- i mean , as to being acquainted with his wife -- for though his sisters , from a superior education , are not to be altogether objected to , it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice .": 411, "the misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates .": 412, "there can be no doubt of your being a gentleman ' s daughter , and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power , or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you .\"": 413, "\" yes , to be sure , i suppose there are .": 414, "but while i visit at hartfield , and you are so kind to me , miss woodhouse , i am not afraid of what any body can do .\"": 415, "\" you understand the force of influence pretty well , harriet ; but i would have you so firmly established in good society , as to be independent even of hartfield and miss woodhouse .": 416, "i want to see you permanently well connected , and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be ; and , therefore , i say that if you should still be in this country when mr . martin marries , i wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters , to be acquainted with the wife , who will probably be some mere farmer ' s daughter , without education .\"": 417, "yes .": 418, "not that i think mr . martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education -- and been very well brought up .": 419, "however , i do not mean to set up my opinion against your ' s -- and i am sure i shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife .": 420, "i shall always have a great regard for the miss martins , especially elizabeth , and should be very sorry to give them up , for they are quite as well educated as me .": 421, "but if he marries a very ignorant , vulgar woman , certainly i had better not visit her , if i can help it .\"": 422, "emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech , and saw no alarming symptoms of love .": 423, "the young man had been the first admirer , but she trusted there was no other hold , and that there would be no serious difficulty , on harriet ' s side , to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own .": 424, "they met mr . martin the very next day , as they were walking on the donwell road .": 425, "he was on foot , and after looking very respectfully at her , looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion .": 426, "emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey ; and walking a few yards forward , while they talked together , soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with mr . robert martin .": 427, "his appearance was very neat , and he looked like a sensible young man , but his person had no other advantage ; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen , she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in harriet ' s inclination .": 428, "harriet was not insensible of manner ; she had voluntarily noticed her father ' s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder .": 429, "mr . martin looked as if he did not know what manner was .": 430, "they remained but a few minutes together , as miss woodhouse must not be kept waiting ; and harriet then came running to her with a smiling face , and in a flutter of spirits , which miss woodhouse hoped very soon to compose .": 431, "\" only think of our happening to meet him !-- how very odd !": 432, "it was quite a chance , he said , that he had not gone round by randalls .": 433, "he did not think we ever walked this road .": 434, "he thought we walked towards randalls most days .": 435, "he has not been able to get the romance of the forest yet .": 436, "he was so busy the last time he was at kingston that he quite forgot it , but he goes again to - morrow .": 437, "so very odd we should happen to meet !": 438, "well , miss woodhouse , is he like

him , i confess , a degree or two nearer gentility .\"": 444, "\" to be sure ,\" said harriet , in a mortified voice , \" he is not so genteel as real gentlemen .\"": 445, "\" i think , harriet ,

, you have had very good specimens of well educated , well bred men .": 447, "i should be surprized if , after seeing them , you could be in company with mr . martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature -- and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before .": 448, "do not you begin to feel that now ?": 449, "were not you struck ?": 450, "i am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner , and the uncouthness of a voice which i heard to be wholly unmodulated as i stood here .\"": 451, "\" certainly , he is not like mr . knightley .": 452, "he has not such a fine air and way of walking as mr . knightley .": 453, "i see the difference plain enough .": 454, "but mr . knightley is so very fine a man !\"": 455,

"compare their manner of carrying themselves ; of walking ; of speaking ; of being silent .": 461, "you must see the difference .\"": 462, "\" oh yes !-- there is a great difference .": 463, "but mr . weston is almost an old man .": 464, "mr . weston must be between forty and fifty .\"": 465, "\" which makes his good manners the more valuable .": 466, "the older a person grows , harriet , the more important it is that their manners should not be bad ; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness , or coarseness , or awkwardness becomes .": 467, "what is passable in youth is detestable in later age .": 468, "mr . martin is now awkward and abrupt ; what will he be at mr . weston ' s time of life ?\"": 469, "\" there is no saying , indeed ,\" replied harriet rather solemnly .": 470, "\" but there may be pretty good guessing .": 471, "he will be a completely gross , vulgar farmer , totally inattentive to appearances , and thinking of nothing but profit and loss .\"": 472, "\" will he ,

he _will_ thrive , and be a very rich man in time -- and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb _us_ .\"": 478, "\" i wonder he did not remember the book \"-- was all harriet ' s answer ,

484, "there is an openness , a quickness , almost a bluntness in mr . weston , which every body likes in _him_ , because there is so much good - humour with it -- but that would not do to be copied .": 485, "neither would mr . knightley ' s downright , decided , commanding sort of manner , though it suits _him_ very well ; his figure , and look , and situation in life seem to allow it ; but if

be an excellent match ; and only too palpably desirable , natural , and probable , for her to have much merit in planning it .": 495, "she feared it was what every body else must think of and predict .": 496, "it was not likely , however , that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan , as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of harriet ' s coming to hartfield

at the same time , not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of harriet .": 499, "he had a comfortable home for her , and emma imagined a very sufficient income ; for though the vicarage of highbury was not large , he was known to have some independent property ; and she thought very highly of him as a good - humoured , well - meaning , respectable young man , without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world .": 500, "she had already satisfied herself that he thought harriet a beautiful girl , which she trusted , with such frequent meetings at hartfield , was foundation enough on his side ; and on harriet ' s there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy .": 501, "and he was really a very pleasing young man , a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like .": 502, "he was reckoned very handsome ; his person much admired in general , though not by her , there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with :-- but the girl who could be gratified by a robert martin ' s riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by mr . elton ' s admiration .": 503, "chapter v": 504, "\" i do not know what your opinion may be , mrs . weston ,\" said mr . knightley , \" of this great intimacy between emma and harriet

fancy her ungrateful , that emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment , he would have been accepted after all .": 885, "this letter , however , was written , and sealed , and

cato throws himself upon his sword ; i quietly take to the ship .": 1311, "there is nothing surprising in this .": 1312, "if they but knew it , almost all men in their degree , some time or other , cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me .": 1313, "there now is your insular city of the manhattoes , belted round by wharves as indian isles by coral reefs -- commerce surrounds it with her surf .": 1314, "right and left , the streets take you waterward .": 1315, "its extreme downtown is the battery , where that noble mole is washed by waves , and cooled by breezes , which a few hours previous were out of sight of land .": 1316, "look at the crowds of water - gazers there .": 1317, "circumambulate the city of a dreamy sabbath afternoon .": 1318, "go from corlears hook to coenties slip , and from thence , by whitehall , northward .": 1319, "what do you see ?-- posted like silent sentinels all around the town , stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries .": 1320, "some leaning against the spiles ; some seated upon the pier - heads ; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from china ; some high aloft in the rigging , as if striving to get a still better seaward peep .": 1321, "but these are all landsmen ; of week days pent up in lath and plaster -- tied to counters , nailed to benches , clinched to desks .": 1322, "how then is this ?": 1323, "are the green fields gone ?": 1324, "what do they here ?": 1325, "but look !": 1326, "here come more crowds , pacing straight for the water , and seemingly bound for a dive .": 1327, "strange !": 1328, "nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land ; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice .": 1329, "no .": 1330, "they must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in .": 1331, "and there they stand -- miles of them -- leagues .": 1332, "inlanders all , they come from lanes and alleys , streets and avenues -- north , east , south , and west .": 1333, "yet here they all unite .": 1334, "tell me , does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither ?": 1335, "once more .": 1336, "say you are in the country ; in some high land of lakes .": 1337, "take almost any path you please , and ten to one it carries you down in a dale , and leaves you there by a pool in the stream .": 1338, "there is magic in it .": 1339, "let the most absent - minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries -- stand that man on his legs , set his feet a - going , and he will infallibly lead you to water , if water there be in all that region .": 1340, "should you ever be athirst in the great american desert , try this experiment , if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor .": 1341, "yes , as every one knows , meditation and water are wedded for ever .": 1342, "but here is an artist .": 1343, "he desires to paint you the dreamiest , shadiest , quietest , most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the saco .": 1344, "what is the chief element he employs ?": 1345, "there stand his trees , each with a hollow trunk , as if a hermit and a crucifix were within ; and here sleeps his meadow , and there sleep his cattle ; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke .": 1346, "deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way , reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill - side blue .": 1347, "but though the picture lies thus tranced , and though this pine - tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd ' s head , yet all were vain , unless the shepherd ' s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him .": 1348, "go visit the prairies in june , when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee - deep among tiger - lilies -- what is the one charm wanting ?-- water -- there is not a drop of water there !": 1349, "were niagara but a cataract of sand , would you travel your thousand miles to see it ?": 1350, "why did the poor poet of tennessee , upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver , deliberate whether to buy him a coat , which he sadly needed , or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to rockaway beach ?": 1351, "why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him , at some time or other crazy to go to sea ?": 1352, "why upon your first voyage as a passenger , did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration , when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land ?": 1353, "why did the old persians hold the sea holy ?": 1354, "why did the greeks give it a separate deity , and own brother of jove ?": 1355, "surely all this is not without meaning .": 1356, "and still deeper the meaning of that story of narcissus , who because he could not grasp the tormenting , mild image he saw in the fountain , plunged into it and was drowned .": 1357, "but that same image , we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans .": 1358, "it is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life ; and this is the key to it all .": 1359, "now , when i say that i am in the habit of going to sea whenever i begin to grow hazy about the eyes , and begin to be over conscious of my lungs , i do not mean to have it inferred that i ever go to sea as a passenger .": 1360, "for to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse , and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it .": 1361, "besides , passengers get sea - sick -- grow quarrelsome -- don ' t sleep of nights -- do not enjoy themselves much , as a general thing ;-- no , i never go as a passenger ; nor , though i am something of a salt , do i ever go to sea as a commodore , or a captain , or a cook .": 1362, "i abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them .": 1363, "for my part , i abominate all honourable respectable toils , trials , and tribulations of every kind whatsoever .": 1364, "it is quite as much as i can do to take care of myself , without taking care of ships , barques , brigs , schooners , and what not .": 1365, "and as for going as cook ,-- though i confess there is considerable glory in that , a cook being a sort of officer on ship - board -- yet , somehow , i never fancied broiling fowls ;-- though once broiled , judiciously buttered , and judgmatically salted and peppered , there is no one who will speak more respectfully , not to say reverentially , of a broiled fowl than i will .": 1366, "it is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse , that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bake - houses the pyramids .": 1367, "no , when i go to sea , i go as a simple sailor , right before the mast , plumb down into the forecastle , aloft there to the royal mast - head .": 1368, "true , they rather order me about some , and make me jump from spar to spar , like a grasshopper in a may meadow .": 1369, "and at first , this sort of thing is unpleasant enough .": 1370, "it touches one ' s sense of honour , particularly if you come of an old established family in the land , the van rensselaers , or randolphs , or hardicanutes .": 1371, "and more than all , if just previous to putting your hand into the tar - pot , you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster , making the tallest boys stand in awe of you .": 1372, "the transition is a keen one , i assure you , from a schoolmaster to a sailor , and requires a strong decoction of seneca and the stoics to enable you to grin and bear it .": 1373, "but even this wears off in time .": 1374, "what of it , if some old hunks of a sea - captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks ?": 1375, "what does that indignity amount to , weighed , i mean , in the scales of the new testament ?": 1376, "do you think the archangel gabriel thinks anything the less of me , because i promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance ?": 1377, "who ain ' t a slave ?": 1378, "tell me that .": 1379, "well , then , however the old sea - captains may order me about -- however they may thump and punch me about , i have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right ; that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way -- either in a physical or metaphysical point of view , that is ; and so the universal thump is passed round , and all hands should rub each other ' s shoulder - blades , and be content .": 1380, "again , i always go to sea as a sailor , because they make a point of paying me for my trouble , whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that i ever heard of .": 1381, "on the contrary , passengers themselves must pay .": 1382, "and there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid .": 1383, "the act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us .": 1384, "but being paid ,-- what will compare with it ?": 1385, "the urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous , considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills , and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven .": 1386, "ah !": 1387, "how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition !": 1388, "finally , i always go to sea as a sailor , because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the fore - castle deck .": 1389, "for as in this world , head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern ( that is , if you never violate the pythagorean maxim ), so for the most part the commodore on the quarter - deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle .": 1390, "he thinks he breathes it first ; but not so .": 1391, "in much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things , at the same time that the leaders little suspect it .": 1392, "but wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor , i should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage ; this the invisible police officer of the fates , who has the constant surveillance of me , and secretly dogs me , and influences me in some unaccountable way -- he can better answer than any one else .": 1393, "and , doubtless , my going on this whaling voyage , formed part of the grand programme of providence that was drawn up a long time ago .": 1394, "it came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances .": 1395, "i take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this :": 1396, "\" grand contested election for the presidency of the united states .": 1397, "\" whaling voyage by one ishmael .": 1398, "\" bloody battle in affghanistan .\"": 1399, "though i cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers , the fates , put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage , when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies , and short and easy parts in genteel comedies , and jolly parts in farces -- though i cannot tell why this was exactly ; yet , now that i recall all the circumstances , i think i can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises , induced me to set about performing the part i did , besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment .": 1400, "chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself .": 1401, "such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity .": 1402, "then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk ; the undeliverable , nameless perils of the whale ; these , with all the attending marvels of a thousand patagonian sights and sounds , helped to sway me to my wish .": 1403, "with other men , perhaps , such things would not have been inducements ; but as for me , i am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote .": 1404, "i love to sail forbidden seas , and land on barbarous coasts .": 1405, "not ignoring what is good , i am quick to perceive a horror , and could still be social with it -- would they let me -- since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in .": 1406, "by reason of these things , then , the whaling voyage was welcome ; the great flood - gates of the wonder - world swung open , and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose , two and two there floated into my inmost soul , endless processions of the whale , and , mid most of them all , one grand hooded phantom , like a snow hill in the air .": 1407, "chapter 2": 1408, "the carpet - bag .": 1409, "i stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet - bag , tucked it under my arm , and started for cape horn and the pacific .": 1410, "quitting the good city of old manhatto , i duly arrived in new bedford .": 1411, "it was a saturday night in december .": 1412, "much was i disappointed upon learning that the little packet for nantucket had already sailed , and that no way of reaching that place would offer , till the following monday .": 1413, "as most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same new bedford , thence to embark on their voyage , it may as well be related that i , for one , had no idea of so doing .": 1414, "for my mind was made up to sail in no other than a nantucket craft , because there was a fine , boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island , which amazingly pleased me .": 1415, "besides though new bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling , and though in this matter poor old nantucket is now much behind her , yet nantucket was her great original -- the tyre of this carthage ;-- the place where the first dead american whale was stranded .": 1416, "where else but from nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen , the red - men , first sally out in canoes to give chase to the leviathan ?": 1417, "and where but from nantucket , too , did that first adventurous little sloop put forth , partly laden with imported cobblestones -- so goes the story -- to throw at the whales , in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit ?": 1418, "now having a night , a day , and still another night following before me in new bedford , ere i could embark for my destined port , it became a matter of concernment where i was to eat and sleep meanwhile .": 1419, "it was a very dubious - looking , nay , a very dark and dismal night , bitingly cold and cheerless .": 1420, "i knew no one in the place .": 1421, "with anxious grapnels i had sounded my pocket , and only brought up a few pieces of silver ,-- so , wherever you go , ishmael , said i to myself , as i stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag , and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south -- wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night , my dear ishmael , be sure to inquire the price , and don ' t be too particular .": 1422, "with halting steps i paced the streets , and passed the sign of \" the crossed harpoons \"-- but it looked too expensive and jolly there .": 1423, "further on , from the bright red windows of the \" sword - fish inn ,\" there came such fervent rays , that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house , for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard , asphaltic pavement ,-- rather weary for me , when i struck my foot against the flinty projections , because from hard , remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight .": 1424, "too expensive and jolly , again thought i , pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street , and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within .": 1425, "but go on , ishmael , said i at last ; don ' t you hear ?": 1426, "get away from before the door ; your patched boots are stopping the way .": 1427, "so on i went .": 1428, "i now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward , for there , doubtless , were the cheapest , if not the cheeriest inns .": 1429, "such dreary streets !": 1430, "blocks of blackness , not houses , on either hand , and here and there a candle , like a candle moving about in a tomb .": 1431, "at this hour of the night , of the last day of the week , that quarter of the town proved all but deserted .": 1432, "but presently i came to a smoky light proceeding from a low , wide building , the door of which stood invitingly open .": 1433, "it had a careless look , as if it were meant for the uses of the public ; so , entering , the first thing i did was to stumble over an ash - box in the porch .": 1434, "thought i , ha , as the flying particles almost choked me , are these ashes from that destroyed city , gomorrah ?": 1435, "but \" the crossed harpoons ,\" and \" the sword - fish ?\"": 1436, "-- this , then must needs be the sign of \" the trap .\"": 1437, "however , i picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within , pushed on and opened a second , interior door .": 1438, "it seemed the great black parliament sitting in tophet .": 1439, "a hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer ; and beyond , a black angel of doom was beating a book in a pulpit .": 1440, "it was a negro church ; and the preacher ' s text was about the blackness of darkness , and the weeping and wailing and teeth - gnashing there .": 1441, "ha , ishmael , muttered i , backing out , wretched entertainment at the sign of ' the trap !'": 1442, "moving on , i at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks , and heard a forlorn creaking in the air ; and looking up , saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it , faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray , and these words underneath --\" the spouter inn :-- peter coffin .\"": 1443, "coffin ?-- spouter ?-- rather ominous in that particular connexion , thought i .": 1444, "but it is a common name in nantucket , they say , and i suppose this peter here is an emigrant from there .": 1445, "as the light looked so dim , and the place , for the time , looked quiet enough , and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district , and as the swinging sign had a poverty - stricken sort of creak to it , i thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings , and the best of pea coffee .": 1446, "it was a queer sort of place -- a gable - ended old house , one side palsied as it were , and leaning over sadly .": 1447, "it stood on a sharp bleak corner , where that tempestuous wind euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor paul ' s tossed craft .": 1448, "euroclydon , nevertheless , is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in - doors , with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed .": 1449, "\" in judging of that tempestuous wind called euroclydon ,\" says an old writer -- of whose works i possess the only copy extant --\" it maketh a marvellous difference , whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside , or whether thou observest it from that sashless window , where the frost is on both sides , and of which the wight death is the only glazier .\"": 1450, "true enough , thought i , as this passage occurred to my mind -- old black - letter , thou reasonest well .": 1451, "yes , these eyes are windows , and this body of mine is the house .": 1452, "what a pity they didn ' t stop up the chinks and the crannies though , and thrust in a little lint here and there .": 1453, "but it ' s too late to make any improvements now .": 1454, "the universe is finished ; the copestone is on , and the chips were carted off a million years ago .": 1455, "poor lazarus there , chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow , and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings , he might plug up both ears with rags , and put a corn - cob into his mouth , and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous euroclydon .": 1456, "euroclydon !": 1457, "says old dives , in his red silken wrapper --( he had a redder one afterwards ) pooh , pooh !": 1458, "what a fine frosty night ; how orion glitters ; what northern lights !": 1459, "let them talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories ; give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals .": 1460, "but what thinks lazarus ?": 1461, "can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights ?": 1462, "would not lazarus rather be in sumatra than here ?": 1463, "would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator ; yea , ye gods !": 1464, "go down to the fiery pit itself , in order to keep out this frost ?": 1465, "now , that lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of dives , this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the moluccas .": 1466, "yet dives himself , he too lives like a czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs , and being a president of a temperance society , he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans .": 1467, "but no more of this blubbering now , we are going a - whaling , and there is plenty of that yet to come .": 1468, "let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet , and see what sort of a place this \" spouter \" may be .": 1469, "chapter 3": 1470, "the spouter - inn .": 1471, "entering that gable - ended spouter - inn , you found yourself in a wide , low , straggling entry with old - fashioned wainscots , reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft .": 1472, "on one side hung a very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked , and every way defaced , that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it , it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it , and careful inquiry of the neighbors , that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose .": 1473, "such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows , that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist , in the time of the new england hags , had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched .": 1474, "but by dint of much and earnest contemplation , and oft repeated ponderings , and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry , you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea , however wild , might not be altogether unwarranted .": 1475, "but what most puzzled and confounded you was a long , limber , portentous , black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue , dim , perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast .": 1476, "a boggy , soggy , squitchy picture truly , enough to drive a nervous man distracted .": 1477, "yet was there a sort of indefinite , half - attained , unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it , till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant .": 1478, "ever and anon a bright , but , alas , deceptive idea would dart you through .-- it ' s the black sea in a midnight gale .-- it ' s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements .-- it ' s a blasted heath .-- it ' s a hyperborean winter scene .-- it ' s the breaking - up of the icebound stream of time .": 1479, "but at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the picture ' s midst .": 1480, "that once found out , and all the rest were plain .": 1481, "but stop ; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish ?": 1482, "even the great leviathan himself ?": 1483, "in fact , the artist ' s design seemed this : a final theory of my own , partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom i conversed upon the subject .": 1484, "the picture represents a cape - horner in a great hurricane ; the half - foundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible ; and an exasperated whale , purposing to spring clean over the craft , is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast - heads .": 1485, "the opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears .": 1486, "some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws ; others were tufted with knots of human hair ; and one was sickle - shaped , with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the new - mown grass by a long - armed mower .": 1487, "you shuddered as you gazed , and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death - harvesting with such a hacking , horrifying implement .": 1488, "mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed .": 1489, "some were storied weapons .": 1490, "with this once long lance , now wildly elbowed , fifty years ago did nathan swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset .": 1491, "and that harpoon -- so like a corkscrew now -- was flung in javan seas , and run away with by a whale , years afterwards slain off the cape of blanco .": 1492, "the original iron entered nigh the tail , and , like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man , travelled full forty feet , and at last was found imbedded in the hump .": 1493, "crossing this dusky entry , and on through yon low - arched way -- cut through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all round -- you enter the public room .": 1494, "a still duskier place is this , with such low ponderous beams above , and such old wrinkled planks beneath , that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft ' s cockpits , especially of such a howling night , when this corner - anchored old ark rocked so furiously .": 1495, "on one side stood a long , low , shelf - like table covered with cracked glass cases , filled with dusty rarities gathered from this wide world ' s remotest nooks .": 1496, "projecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark - looking den -- the bar -- a rude attempt at a right whale ' s head .": 1497, "be that how it may , there stands the vast arched bone of the whale ' s jaw , so wide , a coach might almost drive beneath it .": 1498, "within are shabby shelves , ranged round with old decanters , bottles , flasks ; and in those jaws of swift destruction , like another cursed jonah ( by which name indeed they called him ), bustles a little withered old man , who , for their money , dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death .": 1499, "abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison .": 1500, "though true cylinders without -- within , the villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom .": 1501, "parallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass , surround these footpads ' goblets .": 1502, "fill to this mark , and your charge is but a penny ; to this a penny more ; and so on to the full glass -- the cape horn measure , which you may gulp down for a shilling .": 1503, "upon entering the place i found a number of young seamen gathered about a table , examining by a dim light divers specimens of skrimshander .": 1504, "i sought the landlord , and telling him i desired to be accommodated with a room , received for answer that his house was full -- not a bed unoccupied .": 1505, "\" but avast ,\" he added , tapping his forehead , \" you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer ' s blanket , have ye ?": 1506, "i s ' pose you are goin ' a - whalin ', so you ' d better get used to that sort of thing .\"": 1507, "i told him that i never liked to sleep two in a bed ; that if i should ever do so , it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be , and that if he ( the landlord ) really had no other place for me , and the harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable , why rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night , i would put up with the half of any decent man ' s blanket .": 1508, "\" i thought so .": 1509, "all right ; take a seat .": 1510, "supper ?-- you want supper ?": 1511, "supper ' ll be ready directly .\"": 1512, "i sat down on an old wooden settle , carved all over like a bench on the battery .": 1513, "at one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with his jack - knife , stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his legs .": 1514, "he was trying his hand at a ship under full sail , but he didn ' t make much headway , i thought .": 1515, "at last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room .": 1516, "it was cold as iceland -- no fire at all -- the landlord said he couldn ' t afford it .": 1517, "nothing but two dismal tallow candles , each in a winding sheet .": 1518, "we were fain to button up our monkey jackets , and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers .": 1519, "but the fare was of the most substantial kind -- not only meat and potatoes , but dumplings ; good heavens !": 1520, "dumplings for supper !": 1521, "one young fellow in a green box coat , addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner .": 1522, "\" my boy ,\" said the landlord , \" you ' ll have the nightmare to a dead sartainty .\"": 1523, "\" landlord ,\" i whispered , \" that aint the harpooneer is it ?\"": 1524, "\" oh , no ,\" said he , looking a sort of diabolically funny , \" the harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap .": 1525, "he never eats dumplings , he don ' t -- he eats nothing but steaks , and he likes ' em rare .\"": 1526, "\" the devil he does ,\" says i .": 1527, "\" where is that harpooneer ?": 1528, "is he here ?\"": 1529, "\" he ' ll be here afore long ,\" was the answer .": 1530, "i could not help it , but i began to feel suspicious of this \" dark complexioned \" harpooneer .": 1531, "at any rate , i made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together , he must undress and get into bed before i did .": 1532, "supper over , the company went back to the bar - room , when , knowing not what else to do with myself , i resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a looker on .": 1533, "presently a rioting noise was heard without .": 1534, "starting up , the landlord cried , \" that ' s the grampus ' s crew .": 1535, "i seed her reported in the offing this morning ; a three years ' voyage , and a full ship .": 1536, "hurrah , boys ; now we ' ll have the latest news from the feegees .\"": 1537, "a tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry ; the door was flung open , and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough .": 1538, "enveloped in their shaggy watch coats , and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters , all bedarned and ragged , and their beards stiff with icicles , they seemed an eruption of bears from labrador .": 1539, "they had just landed from their boat , and this was the first house they entered .": 1540, "no wonder , then , that they made a straight wake for the whale ' s mouth -- the bar -- when the wrinkled little old jonah , there officiating , soon poured them out brimmers all round .": 1541, "one complained of a bad cold in his head , upon which jonah mixed him a pitch - like potion of gin and molasses , which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever , never mind of how long standing , or whether caught off the coast of labrador , or on the weather side of an ice - island .": 1542, "the liquor soon mounted into their heads , as it generally does even with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea , and they began capering about most obstreperously .": 1543, "i observed , however , that one of them held somewhat aloof , and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face , yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest .": 1544, "this man interested me at once ; and since the sea - gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate ( though but a sleeping - partner one , so far as this narrative is concerned ), i will here venture upon a little description of him .": 1545, "he stood full six feet in height , with noble shoulders , and a chest like a coffer - dam .": 1546, "i have seldom seen such brawn in a man .": 1547, "his face was deeply brown and burnt , making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast ; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy .": 1548, "his voice at once announced that he was a southerner , and from his fine stature , i thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the alleghanian ridge in virginia .": 1549, "when the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height , this man slipped away unobserved , and i saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea .": 1550, "in a few minutes , however , he was missed by his shipmates , and being , it seems , for some reason a huge favourite with them , they raised a cry of \" bulkington !": 1551, "bulkington !": 1552, "where ' s bulkington ?\"": 1553, "and darted out of the house in pursuit of him .": 1554, "it was now about nine o ' clock , and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgies , i began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen .": 1555, "no man prefers to sleep two in a bed .": 1556, "in fact , you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother .": 1557, "i don ' t know how it is , but people like to be private when they are sleeping .": 1558, "and when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger , in a strange inn , in a strange town , and that stranger a harpooneer , then your objections indefinitely multiply .": 1559, "nor was there any earthly reason why i as a sailor should sleep two in a bed , more than anybody else ; for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea , than bachelor kings do ashore .": 1560, "to be sure they all sleep together in one apartment , but you have your own hammock , and cover yourself with your own blanket , and sleep in your own skin .": 1561, "the more i pondered over this harpooneer , the more i abominated the thought of sleeping with him .": 1562, "it was fair to presume that being a harpooneer , his linen or woollen , as the case might be , would not be of the tidiest , certainly none of the finest .": 1563, "i began to twitch all over .": 1564, "besides , it was getting late , and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards .": 1565, "suppose now , he should tumble in upon me at midnight -- how could i tell from what vile hole he had been coming ?": 1566, "i ' ve changed my mind about that harpooneer .-- i shan ' t sleep with him .": 1567, "i ' ll try the bench here .\"": 1568, "\" just as you please ; i ' m sorry i cant spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress , and it ' s a plaguy rough board here \"-- feeling of the knots and notches .": 1569, "\" but wait a bit , skrimshander ; i ' ve got a carpenter ' s plane there in the bar -- wait , i say , and i ' ll make ye snug enough .\"": 1570, "so saying he procured the plane ; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench , vigorously set to planing away at my bed , the while grinning like an ape .": 1571, "the shavings flew right and left ; till at last the plane - iron came bump against an indestructible knot .": 1572, "the landlord was near spraining his wrist , and i told him for heaven ' s sake to quit -- the bed was soft enough to suit me , and i did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank .": 1573, "so gathering up the shavings with another grin , and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room , he went about his business , and left me in a brown study .": 1574, "i now took the measure of the bench , and found that it was a foot too short ; but that could be mended with a chair .": 1575, "but it was a foot too narrow , and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed one -- so there was no yoking them .": 1576, "i then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall , leaving a little interval between , for my back to settle down in .": 1577, "but i soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window , that this plan would never do at all , especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window , and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where i had thought to spend the night .": 1578, "the devil fetch that harpooneer , thought i , but stop , couldn ' t i steal a march on him -- bolt his door inside , and jump into his bed , not to be wakened by the most violent knockings ?": 1579, "it seemed no bad idea ; but upon second thoughts i dismissed it .": 1580, "for who could tell but what the next morning , so soon as i popped out of the room , the harpooneer might be standing in the entry , all ready to knock me down !": 1581, "still , looking round me again , and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other person ' s bed , i began to think that after all i might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown harpooneer .": 1582, "thinks i , i ' ll wait awhile ; he must be dropping in before long .": 1583, "i ' ll have a good look at him then , and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after all -- there ' s no telling .": 1584, "but though the other boarders kept coming in by ones , twos , and threes , and going to bed , yet no sign of my harpooneer .": 1585, "said i , \" what sort of a chap is he -- does he always keep such late hours ?\"": 1586, "it was now hard upon twelve o ' clock .": 1587, "the landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle , and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension .": 1588, "\" no ,\" he answered , \" generally he ' s an early bird -- airley to bed and airley to rise -- yes , he ' s the bird what catches the worm .": 1589, "but to - night he went out a peddling , you see , and i don ' t see what on airth keeps him so late , unless , may be , he can ' t sell his head .\"": 1590, "\" can ' t sell his head ?-- what sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me ?\"": 1591, "getting into a towering rage .": 1592, "\" do you pretend to say , landlord , that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed saturday night , or rather sunday morning , in peddling his head around this town ?\"": 1593, "\" that ' s precisely it ,\" said the landlord , \" and i told him he couldn ' t sell it here , the market ' s overstocked .\"": 1594, "\" with what ?\"": 1595, "\" with heads to be sure ; ain ' t there too many heads in the world ?\"": 1596, "\" i tell you what it is , landlord ,\" said i quite calmly , \" you ' d better stop spinning that yarn to me -- i ' m not green .\"": 1597, "\" may be not ,\" taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick , \" but i rayther guess you ' ll be done brown if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin ' his head .\"": 1598, "\" i ' ll break it for him ,\" said i , now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord ' s .": 1599, "\" it ' s broke a ' ready ,\" said he .": 1600, "\" broke ,\" said i --\" broke , do you mean ?\"": 1601, "\" sartain , and that ' s the very reason he can ' t sell it , i guess .\"": 1602, "\" landlord ,\" said i , going up to him as cool as mt .": 1603, "hecla in a snow - storm --\" landlord , stop whittling .": 1604, "you and i must understand one another , and that too without delay .": 1605, "i come to your house and want a bed ; you tell me you can only give me half a one ; that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer .": 1606, "and about this harpooneer , whom i have not yet seen , you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow -- a sort of connexion , landlord , which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree .": 1607, "i now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is , and whether i shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him .": 1608, "and in the first place , you will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head , which if true i take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad , and i ' ve no idea of sleeping with a madman ; and you , sir , you i mean , landlord , you , sir , by trying to induce me to do so knowingly , would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution .\"": 1609, "\" wall ,\" said the landlord , fetching a long breath , \" that ' s a purty long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then .": 1610, "but be easy , be easy , this here harpooneer i have been tellin ' you of has just arrived from the south seas , where he bought up a lot of ' balmed new zealand heads ( great curios , you know ), and he ' s sold all on ' em but one , and that one he ' s trying to sell to - night , cause to - morrow ' s sunday , and it would not do to be sellin ' human heads about the streets when folks is goin ' to churches .": 1611, "he wanted to , last sunday , but i stopped him just as he was goin ' out of the door with four heads strung on a string , for all the airth like a string of inions .\"": 1612, "this account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery , and showed that the landlord , after all , had had no idea of fooling me -- but at the same time what could i think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a saturday night clean into the holy sabbath , engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators ?": 1613, "\" depend upon it , landlord , that harpooneer is a dangerous man .\"": 1614, "\" he pays reg ' lar ,\" was the rejoinder .": 1615, "\" but come , it ' s getting dreadful late , you had better be turning flukes -- it ' s a nice bed ; sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced .": 1616, "there ' s plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed ; it ' s an almighty big bed that .": 1617, "why , afore we give it up , sal used to put our sam and little johnny in the foot of it .": 1618, "but i got a dreaming and sprawling about one night , and somehow , sam got pitched on the floor , and came near breaking his arm .": 1619, "arter that , sal said it wouldn ' t do .": 1620, "come along here , i ' ll give ye a glim in a jiffy ;\" and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me , offering to lead the way .": 1621, "but i stood irresolute ; when looking at a clock in the corner , he exclaimed \" i vum it ' s sunday -- you won ' t see that harpooneer to - night ; he ' s come to anchor somewhere -- come along then ; do come ; won ' t ye come ?\"": 1622, "i considered the matter a moment , and then up stairs we went , and i was ushered into a small room , cold as a clam , and furnished , sure enough , with a prodigious bed , almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast .": 1623, "\" there ,\" said the landlord , placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty as a wash - stand and centre table ; \" there , make yourself comfortable now , and good night to ye .\"": 1624, "i turned round from eyeing the bed , but he had disappeared .": 1625, "folding back the counterpane , i stooped over the bed .": 1626, "though none of the most elegant , it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well .": 1627, "i then glanced round the room ; and besides the bedstead and centre table , could see no other furniture belonging to the place , but a rude shelf , the four walls , and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale .": 1628, "of things not properly belonging to the room , there was a hammock lashed up , and thrown upon the floor in one corner ; also a large seaman ' s bag , containing the harpooneer ' s wardrobe , no doubt in lieu of a land trunk .": 1629, "likewise , there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire - place , and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed .": 1630, "but what is this on the chest ?": 1631, "i took it up , and held it close to the light , and felt it , and smelt it , and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it .": 1632, "i can compare it to nothing but a large door mat , ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an indian moccasin .": 1633, "there was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat , as you see the same in south american ponchos .": 1634, "but could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat , and parade the streets of any christian town in that sort of guise ?": 1635, "i put it on , to try it , and it weighed me down like a hamper , being uncommonly shaggy and thick , and i thought a little damp , as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day .": 1636, "i went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall , and i never saw such a sight in my life .": 1637, "i tore myself out of it in such a hurry that i gave myself a kink in the neck .": 1638, "i sat down on the side of the bed , and commenced thinking about this head - peddling harpooneer , and his door mat .": 1639, "after thinking some time on the bed - side , i got up and took off my monkey jacket , and then stood in the middle of the room thinking .": 1640, "i then took off my coat , and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves .": 1641, "but beginning to feel very cold now , half undressed as i was , and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer ' s not coming home at all that night , it being so very late , i made no more ado , but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots , and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed , and commended myself to the care of heaven .": 1642, "whether that mattress was stuffed with corn - cobs or broken crockery , there is no telling , but i rolled about a good deal , and could not sleep for a long time .": 1643, "at last i slid off into a light doze , and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of nod , when i heard a heavy footfall in the passage , and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door .": 1644, "lord save me , thinks i , that must be the harpooneer , the infernal head - peddler .": 1645, "but i lay perfectly still , and resolved not to say a word till spoken to .": 1646, "holding a light in one hand , and that identical new zealand head in the other , the stranger entered the room , and without looking towards the bed , placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner , and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag i before spoke of as being in the room .": 1647, "i was all eagerness to see his face , but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag ' s mouth .": 1648, "this accomplished , however , he turned round -- when , good heavens !": 1649, "what a sight !": 1650, "such a face !": 1651, "it was of a dark , purplish , yellow colour , here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares .": 1652, "yes , it ' s just as i thought , he ' s a terrible bedfellow ; he ' s been in a fight , got dreadfully cut , and here he is , just from the surgeon .": 1653, "but at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light , that i plainly saw they could not be sticking - plasters at all , those black squares on his cheeks .": 1654, "they were stains of some sort or other .": 1655, "at first i knew not what to make of this ; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me .": 1656, "i remembered a story of a white man -- a whaleman too -- who , falling among the cannibals , had been tattooed by them .": 1657, "i concluded that this harpooneer , in the course of his distant voyages , must have met with a similar adventure .": 1658, "and what is it , thought i , after all !": 1659, "it ' s only his outside ; a man can be honest in any sort of skin .": 1660, "but then , what to make of his unearthly complexion , that part of it , i mean , lying round about , and completely independent of the squares of tattooing .": 1661, "to be sure , it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning ; but i never heard of a hot sun ' s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one .": 1662, "however , i had never been in the south seas ; and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin .": 1663, "now , while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning , this harpooneer never noticed me at all .": 1664, "but , after some difficulty having opened his bag , he commenced fumbling in it , and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk , and a seal - skin wallet with the hair on .": 1665, "placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room , he then took the new zealand head -- a ghastly thing enough -- and crammed it down into the bag .": 1666, "he now took off his hat -- a new beaver hat -- when i came nigh singing out with fresh surprise .": 1667, "there was no hair on his head -- none to speak of at least -- nothing but a small scalp - knot twisted up on his forehead .": 1668, "his bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull .": 1669, "had not the stranger stood between me and the door , i would have bolted out of it quicker than ever i bolted a dinner .": 1670, "even as it was , i thought something of slipping out of the window , but it was the second floor back .": 1671, "i am no coward , but what to make of this head - peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension .": 1672, "ignorance is the parent of fear , and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger , i confess i was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night .": 1673, "in fact , i was so afraid of him that i was not game enough just then to address him , and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him .": 1674, "meanwhile , he continued the business of undressing , and at last showed his chest and arms .": 1675, "as i live , these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face ; his back , too , was all over the same dark squares ; he seemed to have been in a thirty years ' war , and just escaped from it with a sticking - plaster shirt .": 1676, "still more , his very legs were marked , as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms .": 1677, "it was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the south seas , and so landed in this christian country .": 1678, "i quaked to think of it .": 1679, "a peddler of heads too -- perhaps the heads of his own brothers .": 1680, "he might take a fancy to mine -- heavens !": 1681, "look at that tomahawk !": 1682, "but there was no time for shuddering , for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention , and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen .": 1683, "going to his heavy grego , or wrapall , or dreadnaught , which he had previously hung on a chair , he fumbled in the pockets , and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back , and exactly the colour of a three days ' old congo baby .": 1684, "remembering the embalmed head , at first i almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner .": 1685, "but seeing that it was not at all limber , and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony , i concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol , which indeed it proved to be .": 1686, "for now the savage goes up to the empty fire - place , and removing the papered fire - board , sets up this little hunch - backed image , like a tenpin , between the andirons .": 1687, "the chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty , so that i thought this fire - place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his congo idol .": 1688, "i now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image , feeling but ill at ease meantime -- to see what was next to follow .": 1689, "first he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket , and places them carefully before the idol ; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp , he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze .": 1690, "presently , after many hasty snatches into the fire , and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers ( whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly ), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit ; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little , he made a polite offer of it to the little negro .": 1691, "but the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all ; he never moved his lips .": 1692, "all these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee , who seemed to be praying in a sing - song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other , during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner .": 1693, "at last extinguishing the fire , he took the idol up very unceremoniously , and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock .": 1694, "all these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness , and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations , and jumping into bed with me , i thought it was high time , now or never , before the light was put out , to break the spell in which i had so long been bound .": 1695, "but the interval i spent in deliberating what to say , was a fatal one .": 1696, "taking up his tomahawk from the table , he examined the head of it for an instant , and then holding it to the light , with his mouth at the handle , he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke .": 1697, "the next moment the light was extinguished , and this wild cannibal , tomahawk between his teeth , sprang into bed with me .": 1698, "i sang out , i could not help it now ; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me .": 1699, "stammering out something , i knew not what , i rolled away from him against the wall , and then conjured him , whoever or whatever he might be , to keep quiet , and let me get up and light the lamp again .": 1700, "but his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning .": 1701, "\" who - e debel you ?\"": 1702, "-- he at last said --\" you no speak - e , dam - me , i kill - e .\" and so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark .": 1703, "\" landlord , for god ' s sake , peter coffin !\"": 1704, "watch !": 1705, "coffin !": 1706, "angels !": 1707, "save me !\"": 1708, "\" speak - e !": 1709, "tell - ee me who - ee be , or dam - me , i kill - e !\"": 1710, "again growled the cannibal , while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till i thought my linen would get on fire .": 1711, "but thank heaven , at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand , and leaping from the bed i ran up to him .": 1712, "\" don ' t be afraid now ,\" said he , grinning again , \" queequeg here wouldn ' t harm a hair of your head .\"": 1713, "\" stop your grinning ,\" shouted i , \" and why didn ' t you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal ?\"": 1714, "\" i thought ye know ' d it ;-- didn ' t i tell ye , he was a peddlin ' heads around town ?-- but turn flukes again and go to sleep .": 1715, "queequeg , look here -- you sabbee me , i sabbee -- you this man sleepe you -- you sabbee ?\"": 1716, "\" me sabbee plenty \"-- grunted queequeg , puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed .": 1717, "\" you gettee in ,\" he added , motioning to me with his tomahawk , and throwing the clothes to one side .": 1718, "he really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way .": 1719, "i stood looking at him a moment .": 1720, "for all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean , comely looking cannibal .": 1721, "what ' s all this fuss i have been making about , thought i to myself -- the man ' s a human being just as i am : he has just as much reason to fear me , as i have to be afraid of him .": 1722, "better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken christian .": 1723, "\" landlord ,\" said i , \" tell him to stash his tomahawk there , or pipe , or whatever you call it ; tell him to stop smoking , in short , and i will turn in with him .": 1724, "but i don ' t fancy having a man smoking in bed with me .": 1725, "it ' s dangerous .": 1726, "besides , i ain ' t insured .\"": 1727, "this being told to queequeg , he at once complied , and again politely motioned me to get into bed -- rolling over to one side as much as to say -- i won ' t touch a leg of ye .\"": 1728, "\" good night , landlord ,\" said i , \" you may go .\"": 1729, "i turned in , and never slept better in my life .": 1730, "chapter 4": 1731, "the counterpane .": 1732, "upon waking next morning about daylight , i found queequeg ' s arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner .": 1733, "you had almost thought i had been his wife .": 1734, "the counterpane was of patchwork , full of odd little parti - coloured squares and triangles ; and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable cretan labyrinth of a figure , no two parts of which were of one precise shade -- owing i suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade , his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times -- this same arm of his , i say , looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt .": 1735, "indeed , partly lying on it as the arm did when i first awoke , i could hardly tell it from the quilt , they so blended their hues together ; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that i could tell that queequeg was hugging me .": 1736, "my sensations were strange .": 1737, "let me try to explain them .": 1738, "when i was a child , i well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me ; whether it was a reality or a dream , i never could entirely settle .": 1739, "the circumstance was this .": 1740, "i had been cutting up some caper or other -- i think it was trying to crawl up the chimney , as i had seen a little sweep do a few days previous ; and my stepmother who , somehow or other , was all the time whipping me , or sending me to bed supperless ,-- my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed , though it was only two o ' clock in the afternoon of the 21st june , the longest day in the year in our hemisphere .": 1741, "i felt dreadfully .": 1742, "but there was no help for it , so up stairs i went to my little room in the third floor , undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time , and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets .": 1743, "i lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before i could hope for a resurrection .": 1744, "sixteen hours in bed !": 1745, "the small of my back ached to think of it .": 1746, "and it was so light too ; the sun shining in at the window , and a great rattling of coaches in the streets , and the sound of gay voices all over the house .": 1747, "i felt worse and worse -- at last i got up , dressed , and softly going down in my stockinged feet , sought out my stepmother , and suddenly threw myself at her feet , beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering for my misbehaviour ; anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time .": 1748, "but she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers , and back i had to go to my room .": 1749, "for several hours i lay there broad awake , feeling a great deal worse than i have ever done since , even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes .": 1750, "at last i must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze ; and slowly waking from it -- half steeped in dreams -- i opened my eyes , and the before sun - lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness .": 1751, "instantly i felt a shock running through all my frame ; nothing was to be seen , and nothing was to be heard ; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine .": 1752, "my arm hung over the counterpane , and the nameless , unimaginable , silent form or phantom , to which the hand belonged , seemed closely seated by my bed - side .": 1753, "for what seemed ages piled on ages , i lay there , frozen with the most awful fears , not daring to drag away my hand ; yet ever thinking that if i could but stir it one single inch , the horrid spell would be broken .": 1754, "i knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me ; but waking in the morning , i shudderingly remembered it all , and for days and weeks and months afterwards i lost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery .": 1755, "nay , to this very hour , i often puzzle myself with it .": 1756, "now , take away the awful fear , and my sensations at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar , in their strangeness , to those which i experienced on waking up and seeing queequeg ' s pagan arm thrown round me .": 1757, "but at length all the past night ' s events soberly recurred , one by one , in fixed reality , and then i lay only alive to the comical predicament .": 1758, "for though i tried to move his arm -- unlock his bridegroom clasp -- yet , sleeping as he was , he still hugged me tightly , as though naught but death should part us twain .": 1759, "i now strove to rouse him --\" queequeg !\"": 1760, "-- but his only answer was a snore .": 1761, "i then rolled over , my neck feeling as if it were in a horse - collar ; and suddenly felt a slight scratch .": 1762, "throwing aside the counterpane , there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage ' s side , as if it were a hatchet - faced baby .": 1763, "a pretty pickle , truly , thought i ; abed here in a strange house in the broad day , with a cannibal and a tomahawk !": 1764, "\" queequeg !-- in the name of goodness , queequeg , wake !\"": 1765, "at length , by dint of much wriggling , and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style , i succeeded in extracting a grunt ; and presently , he drew back his arm , shook himself all over like a newfoundland dog just from the water , and sat up in bed , stiff as a pike - staff , looking at me , and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how i came to be there , though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him .": 1766, "meanwhile , i lay quietly eyeing him , having no serious misgivings now , and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature .": 1767, "when , at last , his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow , and he became , as it were , reconciled to the fact ; he jumped out upon the floor , and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that , if it pleased me , he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards , leaving the whole apartment to myself .": 1768, "thinks i , queequeg , under the circumstances , this is a very civilized overture ; but , the truth is , these savages have an innate sense of delicacy , say what you will ; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are .": 1769, "i pay this particular compliment to queequeg , because he treated me with so much civility and consideration , while i was guilty of great rudeness ; staring at him from the bed , and watching all his toilette motions ; for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding .": 1770, "nevertheless , a man like queequeg you don ' t see every day , he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding .": 1771, "he commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat , a very tall one , by the by , and then -- still minus his trowsers -- he hunted up his boots .": 1772, "what under the heavens he did it for , i cannot tell , but his next movement was to crush himself -- boots in hand , and hat on -- under the bed ; when , from sundry violent gaspings and strainings , i inferred he was hard at work booting himself ; though by no law of propriety that i ever heard of , is any man required to be private when putting on his boots .": 1773, "but queequeg , do you see , was a creature in the transition stage -- neither caterpillar nor butterfly .": 1774, "he was just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners .": 1775, "his education was not yet completed .": 1776, "he was an undergraduate .": 1777, "if he had not been a small degree civilized , he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all ; but then , if he had not been still a savage , he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on .": 1778, "at last , he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes , and began creaking and limping about the room , as if , not being much accustomed to boots , his pair of damp , wrinkled cowhide ones -- probably not made to order either -- rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning .": 1779, "seeing , now , that there were no curtains to the window , and that the street being very narrow , the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room , and observing more and more the indecorous figure that queequeg made , staving about with little else but his hat and boots on ; i begged him as well as i could , to accelerate his toilet somewhat , and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible .": 1780, "he complied , and then proceeded to wash himself .": 1781, "at that time in the morning any christian would have washed his face ; but queequeg , to my amazement , contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest , arms , and hands .": 1782, "he then donned his waistcoat , and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash - stand centre table , dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face .": 1783, "i was watching to see where he kept his razor , when lo and behold , he takes the harpoon from the bed corner , slips out the long wooden stock , unsheathes the head , whets it a little on his boot , and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall , begins a vigorous scraping , or rather harpooning of his cheeks .": 1784, "thinks i , queequeg , this is using rogers ' s best cutlery with a vengeance .": 1785, "afterwards i wondered the less at this operation when i came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made , and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept .": 1786, "the rest of his toilet was soon achieved , and he proudly marched out of the room , wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket , and sporting his harpoon like a marshal ' s baton .": 1787, "chapter 5": 1788, "breakfast .": 1789, "i quickly followed suit , and descending into the bar - room accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly .": 1790, "i cherished no malice towards him , though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow .": 1791, "however , a good laugh is a mighty good thing , and rather too scarce a good thing ; the more ' s the pity .": 1792, "so , if any one man , in his own proper person , afford stuff for a good joke to anybody , let him not be backward , but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way .": 1793, "and the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him , be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for .": 1794, "the bar - room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night previous , and whom i had not as yet had a good look at .": 1795, "they were nearly all whalemen ; chief mates , and second mates , and third mates , and sea carpenters , and sea coopers , and sea blacksmiths , and harpooneers , and ship keepers ; a brown and brawny company , with bosky beards ; an unshorn , shaggy set , all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns .": 1796, "you could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore .": 1797, "this young fellow ' s healthy cheek is like a sun - toasted pear in hue , and would seem to smell almost as musky ; he cannot have been three days landed from his indian voyage .": 1798, "that man next him looks a few shades lighter ; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him .": 1799, "in the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn , but slightly bleached withal ; he doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore .": 1800, "but who could show a cheek like queequeg ?": 1801, "which , barred with various tints , seemed like the andes ' western slope , to show forth in one array , contrasting climates , zone by zone .": 1802, "\" grub , ho !\"": 1803, "now cried the landlord , flinging open a door , and in we went to breakfast .": 1804, "they say that men who have seen the world , thereby become quite at ease in manner , quite self - possessed in company .": 1805, "not always , though : ledyard , the great new england traveller , and mungo park , the scotch one ; of all men , they possessed the least assurance in the parlor .": 1806, "but perhaps the mere crossing of siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as ledyard did , or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach , in the negro heart of africa , which was the sum of poor mungo ' s performances -- this kind of travel , i say , may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish .": 1807, "still , for the most part , that sort of thing is to be had anywhere .": 1808, "these reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table , and i was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling ; to my no small surprise , nearly every man maintained a profound silence .": 1809, "and not only that , but they looked embarrassed .": 1810, "yes , here were a set of sea - dogs , many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas -- entire strangers to them -- and duelled them dead without winking ; and yet , here they sat at a social breakfast table -- all of the same calling , all of kindred tastes -- looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the green mountains .": 1811, "a curious sight ; these bashful bears , these timid warrior whalemen !": 1812, "but as for queequeg -- why , queequeg sat there among them -- at the head of the table , too , it so chanced ; as cool as an icicle .": 1813, "to be sure i cannot say much for his breeding .": 1814, "his greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him , and using it there without ceremony ; reaching over the table with it , to the imminent jeopardy of many heads , and grappling the beefsteaks towards him .": 1815, "but that was certainly very coolly done by him , and every one knows that in most people ' s estimation , to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly .": 1816, "we will not speak of all queequeg ' s peculiarities here ; how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls , and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks , done rare .": 1817, "enough , that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public room , lighted his tomahawk - pipe , and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on , when i sallied out for a stroll .": 1818, "chapter 6": 1819, "the street .": 1820, "if i had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual as queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town , that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets of new bedford .": 1821, "in thoroughfares nigh the docks , any considerable seaport will frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts .": 1822, "even in broadway and chestnut streets , mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies .": 1823, "regent street is not unknown to lascars and malays ; and at bombay , in the apollo green , live yankees have often scared the natives .": 1824, "but new bedford beats all water street and wapping .": 1825, "in these last - mentioned haunts you see only sailors ; but in new bedford , actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners ; savages outright ; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh .": 1826, "it makes a stranger stare .": 1827, "but , besides the feegeeans , tongatobooarrs , erromanggoans , pannangians , and brighggians , and , besides the wild specimens of the whaling - craft which unheeded reel about the streets , you will see other sights still more curious , certainly more comical .": 1828, "there weekly arrive in this town scores of green vermonters and new hampshire men , all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery .": 1829, "they are mostly young , of stalwart frames ; fellows who have felled forests , and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale - lance .": 1830, "many are as green as the green mountains whence they came .": 1831, "in some things you would think them but a few hours old .": 1832, "look there !": 1833, "that chap strutting round the corner .": 1834, "he wears a beaver hat and swallow - tailed coat , girdled with a sailor - belt and sheath - knife .": 1835, "here comes another with a sou '- wester and a bombazine cloak .": 1836, "no town - bred dandy will compare with a country - bred one -- i mean a downright bumpkin dandy -- a fellow that , in the dog - days , will mow his two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands .": 1837, "now when a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation , and joins the great whale - fishery , you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport .": 1838, "in bespeaking his sea - outfit , he orders bell - buttons to his waistcoats ; straps to his canvas trowsers .": 1839, "ah , poor hay - seed !": 1840, "how bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling gale , when thou art driven , straps , buttons , and all , down the throat of the tempest .": 1841, "but think not that this famous town has only harpooneers , cannibals , and bumpkins to show her visitors .": 1842, "not at all .": 1843, "still new bedford is a queer place .": 1844, "had it not been for us whalemen , that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of labrador .": 1845, "as it is , parts of her back country are enough to frighten one , they look so bony .": 1846, "the town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in , in all new england .": 1847, "it is a land of oil , true enough : but not like canaan ; a land , also , of corn and wine .": 1848, "the streets do not run with milk ; nor in the spring - time do they pave them with fresh eggs .": 1849, "yet , in spite of this , nowhere in all america will you find more patrician - like houses ; parks and gardens more opulent , than in new bedford .": 1850, "whence came they ?": 1851, "how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country ?": 1852, "go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion , and your question will be answered .": 1853, "yes ; all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the atlantic , pacific , and indian oceans .": 1854, "one and all , they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea .": 1855, "can herr alexander perform a feat like that ?": 1856, "in new bedford , fathers , they say , give whales for dowers to their daughters , and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a - piece .": 1857, "you must go to new bedford to see a brilliant wedding ; for , they say , they have reservoirs of oil in every house , and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles .": 1858, "in summer time , the town is sweet to see ; full of fine maples -- long avenues of green and gold .": 1859, "and in august , high in air , the beautiful and bountiful horse - chestnuts , candelabra - wise , proffer the passer - by their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms .": 1860, "so omnipotent is art ; which in many a district of new bedford has superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation ' s final day .": 1861, "and the women of new bedford , they bloom like their own red roses .": 1862, "but roses only bloom in summer ; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens .": 1863, "elsewhere match that bloom of theirs , ye cannot , save in salem , where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk , their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore , as though they were drawing nigh the odorous moluccas instead of the puritanic sands .": 1864, "chapter 7": 1865, "the chapel .": 1866, "in this same new bedford there stands a whaleman ' s chapel , and few are the moody fishermen , shortly bound for the indian ocean or pacific , who fail to make a sunday visit to the spot .": 1867, "i am sure that i did not .": 1868, "returning from my first morning stroll , i again sallied out upon this special errand .": 1869, "the sky had changed from clear , sunny cold , to driving sleet and mist .": 1870, "wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin , i fought my way against the stubborn storm .": 1871, "entering , i found a small scattered congregation of sailors , and sailors ' wives and widows .": 1872, "a muffled silence reigned , only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm .": 1873, "each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other , as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable .": 1874, "the chaplain had not yet arrived ; and there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets , with black borders , masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit .": 1875, "three of them ran something like the following , but i do not pretend to quote :--": 1876, "sacred to the memory of john talbot , who , at the age of eighteen , was lost overboard , near the isle of desolation , off patagonia , november 1st , 1836 .": 1877, "this tablet is erected to his memory by his sister .": 1878, "sacred to the memory of robert long , willis ellery , nathan coleman , walter canny , seth macy , and samuel gleig , forming one of the boats ' crews of the ship eliza who were towed out of sight by a whale , on the off - shore ground in the pacific , december 31st , 1839 .": 1879, "this marble is here placed by their surviving shipmates .": 1880, "sacred to the memory of the late captain ezekiel hardy , who in the bows of his boat was killed by a sperm whale on the coast of japan , august 3d , 1833 .": 1881, "this tablet is erected to his memory by his widow .": 1882, "shaking off the sleet from my ice - glazed hat and jacket , i seated myself near the door , and turning sideways was surprised to see queequeg near me .": 1883, "affected by the solemnity of the scene , there was a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance .": 1884, "this savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance ; because he was the only one who could not read , and , therefore , was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall .": 1885, "whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation , i knew not ; but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery , and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief , that i feel sure that here before me were assembled those , in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh .": 1886, "ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass ; who standing among flowers can say -- here , here lies my beloved ; ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these .": 1887, "what bitter blanks in those black - bordered marbles which cover no ashes !": 1888, "what despair in those immovable inscriptions !": 1889, "what deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all faith , and refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave .": 1890, "as well might those tablets stand in the cave of elephanta as here .": 1891, "in what census of living creatures , the dead of mankind are included ; why it is that a universal proverb says of them , that they tell no tales , though containing more secrets than the goodwin sands ; how it is that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world , we prefix so significant and infidel a word , and yet do not thus entitle him , if he but embarks for the remotest indies of this living earth ; why the life insurance companies pay death - forfeitures upon immortals ; in what eternal , unstirring paralysis , and deadly , hopeless trance , yet lies antique adam who died sixty round centuries ago ; how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss ; why all the living so strive to hush all the dead ; wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city .": 1892, "all these things are not without their meanings .": 1893, "but faith , like a jackal , feeds among the tombs , and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope .": 1894, "it needs scarcely to be told , with what feelings , on the eve of a nantucket voyage , i regarded those marble tablets , and by the murky light of that darkened , doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me .": 1895, "yes , ishmael , the same fate may be thine .": 1896, "but somehow i grew merry again .": 1897, "delightful inducements to embark , fine chance for promotion , it seems -- aye , a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet .": 1898, "yes , there is death in this business of whaling -- a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into eternity .": 1899, "but what then ?": 1900, "methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of life and death .": 1901, "methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance .": 1902, "methinks that in looking at things spiritual , we are too much like oysters observing the sun through the water , and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air .": 1903, "methinks my body is but the lees of my better being .": 1904, "in fact take my body who will , take it i say , it is not me .": 1905, "and therefore three cheers for nantucket ; and come a stove boat and stove body when they will , for stave my soul , jove himself cannot .": 1906, "chapter 8": 1907, "the pulpit .": 1908, "i had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness entered ; immediately as the storm - pelted door flew back upon admitting him , a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation , sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain .": 1909, "yes , it was the famous father mapple , so called by the whalemen , among whom he was a very great favourite .": 1910, "he had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth , but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry .": 1911, "at the time i now write of , father mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age ; that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth , for among all the fissures of his wrinkles , there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom -- the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath february ' s snow .": 1912, "no one having previously heard his history , could for the first time behold father mapple without the utmost interest , because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him , imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led .": 1913, "when he entered i observed that he carried no umbrella , and certainly had not come in his carriage , for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet , and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed .": 1914, "however , hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed , and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner ; when , arrayed in a decent suit , he quietly approached the pulpit .": 1915, "like most old fashioned pulpits , it was a very lofty one , and since a regular stairs to such a height would , by its long angle with the floor , seriously contract the already small area of the chapel , the architect , it seemed , had acted upon the hint of father mapple , and finished the pulpit without a stairs , substituting a perpendicular side ladder , like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea .": 1916, "the wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted man - ropes for this ladder , which , being itself nicely headed , and stained with a mahogany colour , the whole contrivance , considering what manner of chapel it was , seemed by no means in bad taste .": 1917, "halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder , and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man - ropes , father mapple cast a look upwards , and then with a truly sailor - like but still reverential dexterity , hand over hand , mounted the steps as if ascending the main - top of his vessel .": 1918, "the perpendicular parts of this side ladder , as is usually the case with swinging ones , were of cloth - covered rope , only the rounds were of wood , so that at every step there was a joint .": 1919, "at my first glimpse of the pulpit , it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship , these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary .": 1920, "for i was not prepared to see father mapple after gaining the height , slowly turn round , and stooping over the pulpit , deliberately drag up the ladder step by step , till the whole was deposited within , leaving him impregnable in his little quebec .": 1921, "i pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this .": 1922, "father mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity , that i could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage .": 1923, "no , thought i , there must be some sober reason for this thing ; furthermore , it must symbolize something unseen .": 1924, "can it be , then , that by that act of physical isolation , he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time , from all outward worldly ties and connexions ?": 1925, "yes , for replenished with the meat and wine of the word , to the faithful man of god , this pulpit , i see , is a self - containing stronghold -- a lofty ehrenbreitstein , with a perennial well of water within the walls .": 1926, "but the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place , borrowed from the chaplain ' s former sea - farings .": 1927, "between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit , the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers .": 1928, "but high above the flying scud and dark - rolling clouds , there floated a little isle of sunlight , from which beamed forth an angel ' s face ; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship ' s tossed deck , something like that silver plate now inserted into the victory ' s plank where nelson fell .": 1929, "\" ah , noble ship ,\" the angel seemed to say , \" beat on , beat on , thou noble ship , and bear a hardy helm ; for lo !": 1930, "the sun is breaking through ; the clouds are rolling off -- serenest azure is at hand .\"": 1931, "nor was the pulpit itself
